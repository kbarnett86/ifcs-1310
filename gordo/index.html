Gordo was one of the first monkeys to make it into space as part of NASA's space program. Eight monkeys had flown on 
NASA missions before him, five of whom went by the name of Albert.

<p><q><em>It takes a smart monkey to make it in space.  We all thought the lack of fresh bananas would be the toughest 
part. None of the Alberts, or myself for that matter, were prepared for how difficult it was to throw poop in zero 
gravity</em></q></p>

Gordo's historic flight took place on December 13, 1958 when he took off from Cape Canaveral for a 15 minute flight 
into space. Even though he was weightless for over 8 minutes the on-board instruments indicated that Gordo enjoyed 
his journey into space. Scientists monitoring the flight were pleased to note that the only slight side effect Gordo 
suffered from the entry into space was a modest slowing of his pulse.

<h3>The Mission</h3>

<p>
The rocket carrying Gordo into space would take off from the Atlantic Missile Range at Cape Canaveral, travel further 
than any monkey had ever travelled before - over 1,500 miles - and reach a height of 310 miles (500 km) before returning
 to Earth and landing in the South Atlantic, 1,302 nautical miles south of Cape Canaveral.

<blockquote>
<p><em>"We all heard the rumors that they want to send a monkey up first.
Well, none of us wants to think that they're gonna 
send a monkey up to do a man's work ... 
  what they're trying to do to us is send a man up to do a monkey's work."</em></p>

<h3>The Jupiter AM-13</h3>

<p>The Jupiter IRBM (Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile) was originally developed by the US Army as a long-range successor
 to its PGM-11 Redstone missile, but was eventually taken over and deployed by the USAF for political reasons. It was also
  the only one of the United States' early stategic ballistic missiles with some mobility.</p>

<h3>The Journey</h3>

Gordo wore a specially customised space suit custom made for a monkey about one foot tall. The space suit was fitted with
 instruments, including temperature meters and microphones which recorded his historic suborbital journey, considered one
  of the outstanding achievements of space research.
