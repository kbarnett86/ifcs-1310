    <h2>Dragon project revision & reflection</h2>
    <p>After having my fiancé review my project dragon website she liked the site and found it easy to navigate and that it worked well especially since I had no experience with web design prior to this course.  

      She did suggest some minor a few minor changes the main one being the addition of a slideshow or something more interactive on the main page.  Also she was not a big fan of my main color scheme.  
      
      I decided to add the slide show that we went through in class to the bottom of my page but I left the color scheme because I liked it and I felt it made the site easy to read.</p>

    <h2>Thoughts on progressive enhancement</h2>
    <p>I found the article assigned on progressive enhancement to be an echo of the mantra we have been hearing all semester.  Start with a good functional HTML structure as the base layer and work out to CSS and Java layer by layer.  Ive always thought about it like a frame of a house but the peanut M&M analogy from the text is good too.  This approach, I believe, is better than the old graceful degradation method because it keeps the user experience and site functionality at the forefront.  With graceful degradation, older browsers and mobile devices were thought of as secondary which may have worked in years past but now with so much traffic on the web happening on mobile devices leaving this much of the users behind isn’t a very functional model for a site that like all sites wants to see as much traffic and great user experience as it can.  Progressive enhancements also is more logical from a design standpoint because it makes it easier to go back and edit sites to make them functional with advancements in technology.  Overall progressive enhancement is better for both users and developers and will likely continue to be the standard in web development for years to come. </p>
