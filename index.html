    <h2>Dragon project revision & reflection</h2>
    <p>After having my fiancé review my project dragon website she liked the site and found it easy to navigate and that it worked well especially since I had no experience with web design prior to this course.  

      She did suggest some minor a few minor changes the main one being the addition of a slideshow or something more interactive on the main page.  Also she was not a big fan of my main color scheme.  
      
      I decided to add the slide show that we went through in class to the bottom of my page but I left the color scheme because I liked it and I felt it made the site easy to read.</p>

    <h2>Thoughts on progressive enhancement</h2>
    <p>Overall I found this course informative, useful and fun! i wish all my classes were like this one! I feel like I picked up HTML quick enough but I know I have much to learn.  CSS was a different challenge as it requires somewhat of a design aspect I don’t feel like I have cultivated fully.  I am looking forward to learning more about CSS and sharpening my design chops in the future.  We only just touched on java but it proved to be a powerful tool that I am also looking forward to getting to know better. </p>
